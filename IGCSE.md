# Course Description

Cambridge IGCSE Computer Science provides an ideal foundation in computer science. Learners gain confidence in computational thinking and programming, an appreciation of automated and emerging technologies and the benefits of their use. They develop an understanding of the main principles of problem-solving by creating computer-based solutions using algorithms and a high-level programming language. Learners also develop a range of technical skills including the ability to test effectively and to evaluate solutions.

Computer Science is a practical subject and a range of practical exercises must be integral to the teaching of this qualification. It is important that learners develop their computational thinking skills by doing practical problem-solving and programming using appropriate resources. It is also expected that learners have the opportunity in class to write their own programs, as well as executing (running), testing and debugging them.
