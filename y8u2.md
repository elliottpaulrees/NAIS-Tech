# The Project

In this module, you’ll explore the exciting world of physical computing using the BBC Micro:bit—a small but powerful device designed to make coding hands-on and fun. We’ll start by learning the basics, including the Micro:bit’s built-in inputs and outputs such as buttons, sensors, and LEDs. Then, you’ll take things further by connecting external components to expand its capabilities. Finally, you’ll apply your skills in a creative robotics project, where you’ll design and build your own robot animal that responds to the environment. Get ready to combine coding, electronics, and imagination to bring your ideas to life!

#### What is the BBC Microbit?

The BBC Micro:bit is a small, programmable device designed to make coding and electronics accessible and fun. At its core, it contains a microcontroller, which is like a tiny computer that can read inputs (such as button presses or sensor data) and control outputs (like LEDs, motors, or speakers). Microcontrollers are widely used in everyday technology—from washing machines to cars—because they allow devices to sense, process, and respond to the world around them. In this module, you’ll learn how the Micro:bit works and how to use it to create interactive projects that combine software and hardware.


## Lesson 1: Basic Input sand Outputs of the Microbit.

#### Lesson objectives
- Identify and describe the built-in LED display and buttons on the BBC Micro:bit and explain their purpose.
- Write and run simple programs to display text and images on the Micro:bit’s LED matrix.
- Use button inputs to trigger actions or change what is displayed on the Micro:bit.

#### Introduction

In this lesson, you’ll take your first steps into programming the BBC Micro:bit and discover how it can display information and respond to your commands. You’ll learn how to use the built-in LED display to show text and images, and explore how the Micro:bit’s buttons can be used as inputs to control what happens on the screen. By the end of the lesson, you’ll understand how to create simple interactive programs that combine outputs and inputs—an essential foundation for all your future projects.

## Lesson 2: Using the Built-In Microbit Sensors

#### Lesson objectives
- Explain what a sensor is and describe its role in physical computing.
- Identify the built-in sensors on the BBC Micro:bit and understand what each one measures.
- Write programs that use sensor data (e.g., accelerometer or temperature) to trigger actions or display information.

#### Introduction

In this lesson, you’ll discover what sensors are and how they allow devices to sense and respond to the world around them. The BBC Micro:bit comes with several built-in sensors, including an accelerometer, compass, and temperature sensor. You’ll learn how these sensors work, how to read their data, and how to use that information to make your programs interactive and responsive. By the end of the lesson, you’ll understand how sensors turn physical changes—like movement or temperature—into digital signals your code can use.

## Lesson 3: Using External Electronic Components

#### Lesson objectives
- Explain how external components (LEDs, buttons, servos) can be connected to the Micro:bit and why they are useful.
- Connect and control external electronics using the Micro:bit’s pins and write programs to operate them.
- Combine inputs and outputs from both built-in and external components to create interactive circuits.

#### Introduction

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to expand the capabilities of your BBC Micro:bit by connecting external components. While the Micro:bit has built-in features, adding extra electronics—such as LEDs, buttons, and servo motors—opens up endless possibilities for creative projects. You’ll discover how to connect these components safely, control them through your code, and use them to make your projects more interactive and dynamic. This is an important step toward building your own robot animal later in the module!
