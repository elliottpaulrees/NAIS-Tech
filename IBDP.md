# Course Description

The IB DP Computer science SL course requires an understanding of the
fundamental concepts of computational thinking as well as knowledge
of how computers and other digital devices operate. The course, underpinned by conceptual thinking, draws on a wide spectrum of knowledge,
and enables and empowers innovation, exploration and the acquisition
of further knowledge. Students study how computer science interacts
with and influences cultures, society and how individuals and societies
behave, and the ethical issues involved. During the course the student
will develop computational solutions. This will involve the ability to:
- identify a problem or unanswered question
- design, prototype and test a proposed solution
- liaise with clients to evaluate the success of the proposed solution
and make recommendations for future developments.

The aims of the computer science standard level courses are to:
- provide opportunities for study and creativity within a global context that will stimulate and challenge students developing the
skills necessary for independent and lifelong learning
- provide a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize computer science
- enable students to apply and use a body of knowledge, methods
and techniques that characterize computer science
- demonstrate initiative in applying thinking skills critically to identify and resolve complex problems
- engender an awareness of the need for, and the value of, effective
collaboration and communication in resolving complex problems
- develop logical and critical thinking as well as experimental, investigative and problem-solving skills
- develop and apply the studentsâ€™ information and communication
technology skills in the study of computer science to communicate information confidently and effectively
- raise awareness of the moral, ethical, social, economic and environmental implications of using science and technology
- develop an appreciation of the possibilities and limitations associated with continued developments in IT systems and computer
science
- encourage an understanding of the relationships between scientific disciplines and the overarching nature of the scientific method.
