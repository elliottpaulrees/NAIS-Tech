# Lesson 1 Binary conversion (Denary to Binary/ Binary to Denary)

## Lesson Objective:
- To be able to convert decimal numbers to binary and binary numbers to decimal with accuracy
- To be able to explain the logical steps involved in binary conversion processes
- To apply binary conversion techniques to solve basic computational problems

## Key learning points

- Computers use binary to represent all data and instructions.
- Binary is a number system consisting of 1s and 0s.
- Binary can be represented by two-state electrical signals within circuits.
- A transistor that is “on” represents a 1; a transistor that is “off” represents a 0.

## Keywords

Data - raw facts, such as numbers or text, presented without any meaning
Binary - a number system that uses the digits 0 and 1 to represent data
Instruction - directions on how to carry out a specific task
Transistor - a tiny electronic switch controlled by electricity.

# Lesson 2 Binary addition
## Lesson Objective:
- To understand the principles of binary number representation and place value
- To be able to perform binary addition involving 1-bit and 2-bit numbers
- To know hot to apply rules for binary addition including carrying over
- To identify and explain overflow in binary arithmetic

## Key learning points
- The process of counting in binary follows the same principle as decimal.
- Binary addition can be achieved with the following facts: 0+0 = 0, 0+1 = 1, 1+1 = 10 and 1+1+1 = 11.

## Keywords

- Addition - a mathematical operation where two or more numbers are combined to find their total
- Carry - the extra value that moves to the next column when the sum of digits in a place value exceeds the basey.
