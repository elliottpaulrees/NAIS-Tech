### Activity 3:

Take a look at the following code which you may have seen when building your Scratch program. You should notice the if blocks have a different type of comparison compared to the ask_hobby functions.

</p>

You can carry out a range of comparisons in your decisions:
  
| Symbol | Meaning                   | Example                |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|   ==   | Is equal to               | if name == "Mr Rees":  |
|   !=   | Not equal to              | if homework != "done": |
|   >    | greater than              | if age > 18:           |
|   <    | less then                 | if score < 50:         |
|   >=   | greater than or equal to  | if goals >= 5:         |
|   <=   | Less than or equal to     | if points <= 10:       |

Add a function to your code which contains a different type of check than what you have already used.
