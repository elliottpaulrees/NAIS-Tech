## ðŸ§© Lesson 3: Creating the game board â€“ Advertising (PowerPoint)

#### Lesson objectives
- To be able to set custom dimensions and layout in Canva for a printable design. Students will learn how to adjust page size and use guides to plan their board layout.
- To be able to use design tools to create a clear and engaging game board. Students will apply shapes, colours, text, and images to make their board easy to understand and fun to play.
- To be able to prepare a digital design for printing and physical assembly.

Create a new Canva project which is 30 cm wide by 30cm high. On your new page, create a visually engaging and functional game board for the game you have designed in earlier lessons. Your design will be printed and turned and turned into the physical board for your project. 

After the project has been submitted, you wil be given your printed game sheet and a 30cm x 30cm sheet of corregated cardboard. Carefully cut out the sheet and stick your printed game sheet to the provided cardboard, ensuring it lines up and no airbubbles are trapped.
