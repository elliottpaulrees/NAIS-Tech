# The Project

This scheme of work introduces students to the exciting world of physical computing through hands-on Arduino projects. Over the course of several lessons, learners will explore how software and hardware interact to create real-world solutions. Starting with simple circuits such as LEDs and buttons, students will progress to more complex systems involving sensors, buzzers, transistors, and servo motors. Each project combines practical electronics with coding challenges, helping students develop problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and creativity. By the end of the unit, students will not only understand the fundamentals of microcontroller programming and circuit design but will also apply these skills to design and build their own interactive technology project.

#### What is an Arduino?
An Arduino is a small computer you can hold in your hand. It doesn’t have a screen or keyboard, but you can tell it what to do by writing simple code on your computer and sending it to the board. Unlike your laptop which is designed to save and run many computer programs, an arduino is designed to run one program only.

With Arduino, you can control real things using electronics — like making a robot arm wave hello, building a motion-sensing alarm that buzzes when someone walks by, creating a light show that reacts to music, or even designing a mini weather station that tells you the temperature and humidity. It's like turning your ideas into real gadgets with just a few wires and lines of code.


## Lesson 1: Intro to Arduino, breadboards, and LED control

#### Lesson objectives
- Understand the role of resistors and LEDs in a circuit.
- Learn how to configure Arduino pins for output using pinMode().
- Write a simple program to turn an LED on and off.

#### Introduction

In this activity, you will make an LED blink using an Arduino. This simple project shows how code can control hardware. You’ll connect an LED to your Arduino, write a short program, and upload it to see the LED turn on and off at regular intervals. This is your first step in learning how electronics and programming work together.

#### Task 1 - Flashing an LED.

##### The Hardware

In this activity, you will build a simple circuit that makes an LED flash using an Arduino. An LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a small light that only works when electricity flows in the correct direction. This means LEDs have polarity: the longer leg is the positive side (called the anode), and the shorter leg is the negative side (called the cathode). To protect the LED from too much current, we use a resistor, which limits the flow of electricity.

Every circuit needs a complete path for electricity to flow: from the Arduino’s power pin, through the LED and resistor, and back to GND (ground) on the Arduino. If the circuit is not connected to ground, it will not work. Once the LED is wired correctly, you will upload a program to make it turn on and off repeatedly, creating a blinking effect.

Create the circuit in the image below.

##### The Software - Variables, delays and outputs 

This program below tells the Arduino to make the LED blink. First, we create a variable ledPin to store the pin number where the LED is connected (pin 13). In the setup() function, we set this pin as an output, so the Arduino can send power to the LED. 

The loop() function runs over and over: it turns the LED ON with digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH), waits for one second using delay(1000), then turns the LED OFF with digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW) and waits another second. This cycle repeats forever, making the LED flash on and off.

```cpp

int ledPin = 13; // Pin where the LED is connected

void setup() { // This function runs one at the start of the program.
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // Set the LED pin as an output
}

void loop() { // This function runs after setup and repeats forever.
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn the LED ON
  delay(1000);                // Wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds)
  
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // Turn the LED OFF
  delay(1000);                // Wait for 1 second
}
```

#### Task 2:
We could make our program more interesting by adding more LED's. Improve your circuit by making three LED's turn on one by one, before turning off one by one.

## Lesson 2: Push Buttons and LED continued

#### Lesson objectives
- Explain how push buttons work as input devices.
- Use digitalRead() to detect button presses.
- To be able to create a platform which reacts to button presses.

#### Introduction

In this activity, you will add a push button to your Arduino circuit. A button is an input device that allows you to control what happens in your program by pressing it. When the button is pressed, it completes the circuit and sends a signal to the Arduino. You will learn how to wire the button correctly, why it needs a resistor, and how to write code that responds to button presses by turning an LED on or off.


#### Task 1 – Using a Push Button
The Hardware
A push button works by connecting two sides of the circuit when pressed. In this circuit:

One side of the button connects to power (5V).
The other side connects to an Arduino digital input pin.
A resistor is used as a pull-down resistor to ensure the pin reads LOW when the button is not pressed.
The LED remains connected as before, but now it will only turn on when the button is pressed.

Every circuit still needs a complete path: from power → through the button → to the Arduino pin → and back to GND.
Create the circuit shown in the image below:

</p>

#### The Software - Using decisions and taking inputs
This program reads the button state and turns the LED on when the button is pressed:

```cpp
int ledPin = 13;       // LED connected to pin 13
int buttonPin = 2;     // Button connected to pin 2

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      // LED is an output
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);    // Button is an input
}

void loop() {
  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); // Read button state

  if (buttonState == HIGH) {    // If button is pressed
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn LED ON
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // Turn LED OFF
  }
}
```

#### Task 2 – Make It More Interesting
Modify your program so that:

The LED toggles on and off each time you press the button (instead of only staying on while pressed).
Hint: You will need a variable to remember the LED state and use an if statement to change it.

## Lesson 3: Sensing Temperature

#### Lesson objectives
- Understand how temperature sensors (e.g., TMP36 or similar) provide analog data.
- Use analogRead() to capture sensor values and convert them into temperature readings.
- To be able to use if statements to change the output based on the temperature.

#### Introduction

In this activity, you will use a temperature sensor to measure the surrounding temperature and display the result using your Arduino. A temperature sensor converts heat into an electrical signal that the Arduino can read. Unlike buttons or LEDs, which use digital signals (ON or OFF), temperature sensors provide analog values that vary depending on the temperature. You will learn how to connect the sensor correctly, why it needs three connections (power, ground, and signal), and how to write code that converts the sensor’s output into a readable temperature.

#### Task 1 – Reading the temperature

Here’s what happens in this circuit:

- The sensor has three pins:

  - VCC (power) connects to 5V on the Arduino.
  - GND connects to ground.
  - Signal connects to an analog input pin (e.g., A0).

- The Arduino reads the voltage from the signal pin and converts it into a temperature value.

Create the circuit shown in the image below:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/illustrations/Arduino3.png" width="75%" height="auto">
</p>

The Software
This program reads the sensor value and converts it into Celsius:

```cpp

int sensorPin = A0;    // Temperature sensor connected to analog pin A0
int ledPin = 4;        // LED connected to digital pin 4

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);          // Start Serial Monitor
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);     // Set LED pin as output
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);           // Read analog value
  float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0);      // Convert to voltage
  float temperatureC = (voltage - 0.5) * 100;        // Convert to Celsius (TMP36 formula)

  Serial.print("Temperature: ");
  Serial.print(temperatureC);
  Serial.println(" °C");

  // Turn LED ON if temperature is above 20°C
  if (temperatureC > 20) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }

  delay(1000); // Wait 1 second before next reading
}

```


#### Task 2 - Making it more interesting.

Can you edit your design to have three LED's. Your code should have the following rules:
- LED 1 turns on if the temperature is over 30 degrees.
- LED 2 turns on if the temperature is between 20 and 30 degrees.
- LED 3 turns on if the temperature is below 20 degreees.
- Only 1 LED should be on at a time.

## Lesson 4: Sensing Light

#### Lesson objectives
- Explain how a photoresistor (LDR) works and its role in detecting light levels.
- Use analogRead() to measure light intensity and interpret the values.
- Write a program that responds to light changes (e.g., turning on an LED when it’s dark).

#### Introduction

In this activity, you will build a Light Alarm using an Arduino, a photoresistor (LDR), an LED, and a buzzer. The photoresistor changes its resistance based on light intensity, which the Arduino reads as an analog value. You will write code that reacts to different light levels by turning on an LED and sounding a buzzer. This project introduces multiple outputs and structured decision-making using if / else if / else.

#### Task 1 – Measuring light

Create a circuit which monitors the light levels and turns a light on when its dark!

Task 2:
Change the volume of the buzzer to follow these rules: 
- Be silent if there is high light levels.
- emit low levels of sound if there is medium-high light levels.
- emit medium levels of sound if there is medium-high light levels.
- Be loud if there is no light detected.


## Lesson 5: Sensing Distance

#### Lesson objectives
- Understand how ultrasonic sensors measure distance using sound waves.
- Use Arduino functions to read distance data from a sonar sensor.
- Implement a program that reacts to distance changes (e.g., activating an LED or buzzer when an object is too close).
