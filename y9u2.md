# The Project

This scheme of work introduces students to the exciting world of physical computing through hands-on Arduino projects. Over the course of several lessons, learners will explore how software and hardware interact to create real-world solutions. Starting with simple circuits such as LEDs and buttons, students will progress to more complex systems involving sensors, buzzers, transistors, and servo motors. Each project combines practical electronics with coding challenges, helping students develop problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and creativity. By the end of the unit, students will not only understand the fundamentals of microcontroller programming and circuit design but will also apply these skills to design and build their own interactive technology project.

#### What is an Arduino?
An Arduino is a small computer you can hold in your hand. It doesn’t have a screen or keyboard, but you can tell it what to do by writing simple code on your computer and sending it to the board. Unlike your laptop which is designed to save and run many computer programs, an arduino is designed to run one program only.

With Arduino, you can control real things using electronics — like making a robot arm wave hello, building a motion-sensing alarm that buzzes when someone walks by, creating a light show that reacts to music, or even designing a mini weather station that tells you the temperature and humidity. It's like turning your ideas into real gadgets with just a few wires and lines of code.


## Lesson 1: Intro to Arduino, breadboards, and LED control

#### Lesson objectives
- Understand the role of resistors and LEDs in a circuit.
- Learn how to configure Arduino pins for output using pinMode().
- Write a simple program to turn an LED on and off.

#### Introduction

In this activity, you will make an LED blink using an Arduino. This simple project shows how code can control hardware. You’ll connect an LED to your Arduino, write a short program, and upload it to see the LED turn on and off at regular intervals. This is your first step in learning how electronics and programming work together.

In this activity, you will build a simple circuit that makes an LED flash using an Arduino. An LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a small light that only works when electricity flows in the correct direction. This means LEDs have polarity: the longer leg is the positive side (called the anode), and the shorter leg is the negative side (called the cathode). To protect the LED from too much current, we use a resistor, which limits the flow of electricity.

Every circuit needs a complete path for electricity to flow: from the Arduino’s power pin, through the LED and resistor, and back to GND (ground) on the Arduino. If the circuit is not connected to ground, it will not work. Once the LED is wired correctly, you will upload a program to make it turn on and off repeatedly, creating a blinking effect.

## Lesson 2: Push Buttons and LED continued

#### Lesson objectives
- Explain how push buttons work as input devices.
- Use digitalRead() to detect button presses.
- To be able to create a platform which reacts to button presses.

#### Introduction

In this activity, you will add a push button to your Arduino circuit. A button is an input device that allows you to control what happens in your program by pressing it. When the button is pressed, it completes the circuit and sends a signal to the Arduino. You will learn how to wire the button correctly, why it needs a resistor, and how to write code that responds to button presses by turning an LED on or off.

## Lesson 3: Sensing Temperature

#### Lesson objectives
- Understand how temperature sensors (e.g., TMP36 or similar) provide analog data.
- Use analogRead() to capture sensor values and convert them into temperature readings.
- To be able to use if statements to change the output based on the temperature.

#### Introduction

In this activity, you will use a temperature sensor to measure the surrounding temperature and display the result using your Arduino. A temperature sensor converts heat into an electrical signal that the Arduino can read. Unlike buttons or LEDs, which use digital signals (ON or OFF), temperature sensors provide analog values that vary depending on the temperature. You will learn how to connect the sensor correctly, why it needs three connections (power, ground, and signal), and how to write code that converts the sensor’s output into a readable temperature.

## Lesson 4: Sensing Light

#### Lesson objectives
- Explain how a photoresistor (LDR) works and its role in detecting light levels.
- Use analogRead() to measure light intensity and interpret the values.
- Write a program that responds to light changes (e.g., turning on an LED when it’s dark).

#### Introduction

In this activity, you will build a Light Alarm using an Arduino, a photoresistor (LDR), an LED, and a buzzer. The photoresistor changes its resistance based on light intensity, which the Arduino reads as an analog value. You will write code that reacts to different light levels by turning on an LED and sounding a buzzer. This project introduces multiple outputs and structured decision-making using if / else if / else.

## Lesson 5: Moving Servos

#### Lesson objectives
- Explain how a servo motor works and how it differs from other actuators.
- Connect a servo motor and a push button to an Arduino correctly.
- Write and modify code to control a servo motor using a button press.

#### Introduction

In this activity, you will learn how to control movement using a servo motor and a push button. Servos are widely used in robotics and automation because they allow precise control of position. By pressing a button, the servo will rotate to a set angle, wait for a short time, and then return to its original position. This activity builds on previous lessons about digital inputs and outputs, combining them to create a simple interactive mechanism—similar to how gates, locks, and robotic arms operate in real-world systems.
