# The Project

 In this unit, we’ll explore how computers make decisions by breaking down problems into clear, logical steps using flowcharts. You’ll also revisit key programming techniques in Scratch, sharpening your skills in sequencing, loops, and conditionals. This foundation will prepare you to transition confidently into Python, where you’ll start writing real code and building programs from scratch (pun intended).


## Lesson 1: Intro to Arduino, breadboards, and LED control

#### Lesson objectives
- To know what a flowchart is and its purpose.
- To understand the meaning behind the different shapes of a flow chart.
- To be able to create flowcharts which represent logic I am comfortable with.

Task 2:
Can you get 3 LED's flashing one after the other:

## Lesson 2: Push Buttons and LED continued

#### Lesson objectives
- To know what a flowchart is and its purpose.
- To understand the meaning behind the different shapes of a flow chart.

Task 2:
Can you use a button to trigger a 3 LED's turn turn on, one after the other?

## Lesson 3: Sensing Temperature

#### Lesson objectives
- To know what a flowchart is and its purpose.
- To understand the meaning behind the different shapes of a flow chart.
- To be able to create flowcharts which represent logic I am comfortable with.

Task 2:
Can you edit your design to have three LED's. Your code should have the following rules:
- LED 1 turns on if the temperature is over 30 degrees.
- LED 2 turns on if the temperature is between 20 and 30 degrees.
- LED 3 turns on if the temperature is below 20 degreees.
- Only 1 LED should be on at a time.

## Lesson 4: Sensing Light

#### Lesson objectives
- To know what a flowchart is and its purpose.
- To understand the meaning behind the different shapes of a flow chart.
- To be able to create flowcharts which represent logic I am comfortable with.

Task 2:
Change the volume of the buzzer to follow these rules: 
- Be silent if there is high light levels.
- emit low levels of sound if there is medium-high light levels.
- emit medium levels of sound if there is medium-high light levels.
- Be loud if there is no light detected.


## Lesson 5: Sensing Distance

#### Lesson objectives
- To know what a flowchart is and its purpose.
- To understand the meaning behind the different shapes of a flow chart.
- To be able to create flowcharts which represent logic I am comfortable with.
