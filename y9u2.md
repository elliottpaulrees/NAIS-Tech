# The Project

This scheme of work introduces students to the exciting world of physical computing through hands-on Arduino projects. Over the course of several lessons, learners will explore how software and hardware interact to create real-world solutions. Starting with simple circuits such as LEDs and buttons, students will progress to more complex systems involving sensors, buzzers, transistors, and servo motors. Each project combines practical electronics with coding challenges, helping students develop problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and creativity. By the end of the unit, students will not only understand the fundamentals of microcontroller programming and circuit design but will also apply these skills to design and build their own interactive technology project.


## Lesson 1: Intro to Arduino, breadboards, and LED control

#### Lesson objectives
- Understand the role of resistors and LEDs in a circuit.
- Learn how to configure Arduino pins for output using pinMode().
- Write a simple program to turn an LED on and off.

Task 2:
Can you get 3 LED's flashing one after the other:

## Lesson 2: Push Buttons and LED continued

#### Lesson objectives
- Explain how push buttons work as input devices.
- Use digitalRead() to detect button presses.
- Control a buzzer based on user input through conditional statements.

Task 2:
Can you use a button to trigger a 3 LED's turn turn on, one after the other?

## Lesson 3: Sensing Temperature

#### Lesson objectives
- Understand how temperature sensors (e.g., TMP36 or similar) provide analog data.
- Use analogRead() to capture sensor values and convert them into temperature readings.
- To be able to use if statements to change the output based on the temperature.

Task 2:
Can you edit your design to have three LED's. Your code should have the following rules:
- LED 1 turns on if the temperature is over 30 degrees.
- LED 2 turns on if the temperature is between 20 and 30 degrees.
- LED 3 turns on if the temperature is below 20 degreees.
- Only 1 LED should be on at a time.

## Lesson 4: Sensing Light

#### Lesson objectives
- Explain how a photoresistor (LDR) works and its role in detecting light levels.
- Use analogRead() to measure light intensity and interpret the values.
- Write a program that responds to light changes (e.g., turning on an LED when it’s dark).

Task 2:
Change the volume of the buzzer to follow these rules: 
- Be silent if there is high light levels.
- emit low levels of sound if there is medium-high light levels.
- emit medium levels of sound if there is medium-high light levels.
- Be loud if there is no light detected.


## Lesson 5: Sensing Distance

#### Lesson objectives
- Understand how ultrasonic sensors measure distance using sound waves.
- Use Arduino functions to read distance data from a sonar sensor.
- Implement a program that reacts to distance changes (e.g., activating an LED or buzzer when an object is too close).
