# The Project

 In this unit, we’ll explore how computers make decisions by breaking down problems into clear, logical steps using flowcharts. You’ll also revisit key programming techniques in Scratch, sharpening your skills in sequencing, loops, and conditionals. This foundation will prepare you to transition confidently into Python, where you’ll start writing real code and building programs from scratch (pun intended).


## Lesson 1: Introduction to Flow Charts

#### Lesson objectives
- To know what a flowchart is and its purpose.
- To understand the meaning behind the different shapes of a flow chart.
- To be able to create flowcharts which represent logic I am comfortable with.

# Lesson 4: Transitioning to text based coding languages. 

#### Lesson objectives
- Declare and use variables (int, float, String).
- Perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Use functions to organise code.
- Use conditionals to control program flow.
- Combine with variables and functions for structured programs.



### What is an Arduino?
An Arduino is a small computer you can hold in your hand. It doesn’t have a screen or keyboard, but you can tell it what to do by writing simple code on your computer and sending it to the board. Unlike your laptop which is designed to save and run many computer programs, an arduino is designed to run one program only.

With Arduino, you can control real things using electronics — like making a robot arm wave hello, building a motion-sensing alarm that buzzes when someone walks by, creating a light show that reacts to music, or even designing a mini weather station that tells you the temperature and humidity. It's like turning your ideas into real gadgets with just a few wires and lines of code.



## Activity 1: Copy and run the code below. Ensure you understand it before moving onto Activity 2.

Write the


```cpp
float areaOfSquare(float side) {
  float area = side * side; // multiply side by itself
  return area;              // return the result
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // start the Serial Monitor

  float sideLength = 5.0; // example side length in cm
  float area = areaOfSquare(sideLength);

  Serial.print("The area of a square with side ");
  Serial.print(sideLength);
  Serial.print(" cm is ");
  Serial.print(area);
  Serial.println(" cm²");
}

void loop() {
  // Nothing needed here for now
}
```

### Key Information: You must outline the data type of variables when programmign with Arduino.

| Data Type     |Description         | Example      |
|:-------------:|:------------------:|:------------:|
| Integer       | A whole number     |  10          |
| String        | Words and Sentences| Hello Year 9!| 
| Float         | A decimal number   |    4.1       | 
| Boolean       | True or False      | True or 1    | 


## Activity 2: Add additional functions to the program which have the following functionality:
- Create a function which converts a temperature in celcius to fahrenheit 
- Create a function which calcuate the average of three numbers.
- Create a function which converts USD to HKD.
- Create a function which calculates how far an object has moved.
- Create a function which calculates the area of a circle.

## Activity 3: An if statement allows us to make some thing happen IF a condition is true. Copy and run the code below to see how it works.

```cpp
void ageChecker(int age) {
  if (age > 18) {
    Serial.println("You're too old to go to NAIS HK!");
  } 
  else if (age >= 16) {
    Serial.println("You can join the IBDP course!");
  } 
  else if (age >= 14) {
    Serial.println("You can join the IGCSE course!");
  } 
  else {
    Serial.println("You are in KS3!");
  }
}

```


## Activity 4: Add additional functions to the program which have the following functionality:
- Checks if two numbers are the same.
- Identifies which is the largest out of two numbers.
- Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
- Write a program that categorises a temperature (Hot / Warm / Cold).
- Assigns grades to the user based on a score (A > 80, B > 70, C > 60 etc...) 

# Lesson 5: Programming Arduino Devices in Tinkercad – Lesson 1 

#### Lesson objectives
- Able to create a Tinkercad account using their school Microsoft account 
- Able to use Tinkercad tutorials to create Arduino Circuit projects 
- Able to use the Block-based programming interface to create basic Arduino Circuits

## Activity 1: My Tinkercad account
Students created their Tinkercad account using their school Microsoft account, not their personal/private account 

## Activity 2: Arduino-based Circuits in Tinkercad

</p>

Students use the “Code” button to switch between the Block-based, Text-based, and Block+Text-based interfaces 

Students are invited to compare the code between the various project created and start making notes/connections between the blocks and the C++ code 

## Extension:
