# The Project

 In this unit, we’ll explore how computers make decisions by breaking down problems into clear, logical steps using flowcharts. You’ll also revisit key programming techniques in Scratch, sharpening your skills in sequencing, loops, and conditionals. This foundation will prepare you to transition confidently into Python, where you’ll start writing real code and building programs from scratch (pun intended).


## Lesson 1: Introduction to Flow Charts

#### Lesson objectives
- To know what a flowchart is and its purpose.
- To understand the meaning behind the different shapes of a flow chart.
- To be able to create flowcharts which represent logic I am comfortable with.

### What is an Arduino?
An Arduino is a small computer you can hold in your hand. It doesn’t have a screen or keyboard, but you can tell it what to do by writing simple code on your computer and sending it to the board. Unlike your laptop which is designed to save and run many computer programs, an arduino is designed to run one program only.

With Arduino, you can control real things using electronics — like making a robot arm wave hello, building a motion-sensing alarm that buzzes when someone walks by, creating a light show that reacts to music, or even designing a mini weather station that tells you the temperature and humidity. It's like turning your ideas into real gadgets with just a few wires and lines of code.




```cpp
float areaOfSquare(float side) {
  float area = side * side; // multiply side by itself
  return area;              // return the result
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // start the Serial Monitor

  float sideLength = 5.0; // example side length in cm
  float area = areaOfSquare(sideLength);

  Serial.print("The area of a square with side ");
  Serial.print(sideLength);
  Serial.print(" cm is ");
  Serial.print(area);
  Serial.println(" cm²");
}

void loop() {
  // Nothing needed here for now
}
```
