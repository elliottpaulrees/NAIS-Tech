# Course Description

This year, you’ll dive into the exciting world of technology and creativity. You’ll start by building games and animations in Scratch, then level up to writing real code in Python. Along the way, you’ll explore fabrication—designing and creating physical objects using 3D printers and laser cutters — and get hands-on with robotics, where your code will bring machines to life. Whether you're a curious creator or a future engineer, this journey is all about learning by doing and having fun while you build the future.
Click on each module to dive into the projects and see what you'll be creating.

# Modules:
- [Computer Programming Introduction In Scratch & Python](\y8u1)
