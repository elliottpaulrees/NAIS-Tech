# The Project

In this unit, you’ll begin your journey into computer programming by learning key concepts using Scratch—a fun and visual way to understand how code works. Once you’ve built confidence with Scratch, you’ll move on to Python, a powerful text-based language used by real developers. The skills you learn in Python will prepare you for exciting projects later in the year, including programming robots to follow instructions and interact with the world around them. Get ready to think logically, solve problems, and bring your ideas to life through code!

## Lesson 1: Introduction input, output, variables and functions

#### Lesson objectives
- To ensure all fiels and folders are organised for the year ahead.
- To be able to use input and output commands.
- To be able to store data in variables.
- To be able to structure you code using functions.

## Lesson 2: Creating the game board – Advertising (PowerPoint)

#### Lesson objectives
- To be able to use decisions in your code to control the flow of logic.
- To be able to carry out comparisons such as checking if two values are equal, not equal or if one value is greater than another.
- To be able to carry out calculations which make use of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division in your code.

## Lesson 3: Creating the game board – Advertising (PowerPoint)

#### Lesson objectives
- To know a program is a set of commands that can be run by a computer for it to do a task. 
- To understand that All programming languages have rules for syntax that must be followed so that the program can run. 
- To be able to use the print() function to output information from a Python program. 
- To be able to use the input() function to allow the user to enter information into a Python program.

### Do Now:
During lesson one, you created a chatbot using the following program.

</p>


Compare the following code:

```python
def ask_name():
  print("What is your name?")
  name = input()
  print("hello ", name)

print("Hello")
print("I am big Ed from the year 2182")
ask_name()
```

### Activity 1:
1. Go to the following website: https://www.online-python.com
2. Copy the above code to see it run. Does it ru

### Activity 2:
Recreate your chatbot from the first lesson using the Python programming language. Your program should ask a question, save the response in a variable and include the users answer in the response. We will add the personalised responses using the "if blocks" within the next lesson.
