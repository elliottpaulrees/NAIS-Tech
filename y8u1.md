# The Project

In this unit, you’ll begin your journey into computer programming by learning key concepts using Scratch—a fun and visual way to understand how code works. Once you’ve built confidence with Scratch, you’ll move on to Python, a powerful text-based language used by real developers. The skills you learn in Python will prepare you for exciting projects later in the year, including programming robots to follow instructions and interact with the world around them. Get ready to think logically, solve problems, and bring your ideas to life through code!

## Lesson 1: Introduction input, output, variables and functions

#### Lesson objectives
- To ensure all fiels and folders are organised for the year ahead.
- To be able to use input and output commands.
- To be able to store data in variables.
