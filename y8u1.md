# The Project

In this unit, you’ll begin your journey into computer programming by learning key concepts using Scratch—a fun and visual way to understand how code works. Once you’ve built confidence with Scratch, you’ll move on to Python, a powerful text-based language used by real developers. The skills you learn in Python will prepare you for exciting projects later in the year, including programming robots to follow instructions and interact with the world around them. Get ready to think logically, solve problems, and bring your ideas to life through code!

## Lesson 1: Introduction input, output, variables and functions

#### Lesson objectives
- To ensure all fiels and folders are organised for the year ahead.
- To be able to use input and output commands.
- To be able to store data in variables.
- To be able to structure you code using functions.

## Lesson 2: Calculations in Scratch

#### Lesson objectives
- To be able to use decisions in your code to control the flow of logic.
- To be able to carry out comparisons such as checking if two values are equal, not equal or if one value is greater than another.
- To be able to carry out calculations which make use of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division in your code.

## Lesson 3: Introduction to Python

#### Lesson objectives
- To know a program is a set of commands that can be run by a computer for it to do a task. 
- To understand that All programming languages have rules for syntax that must be followed so that the program can run. 
- To be able to use the print() function to output information from a Python program. 
- To be able to use the input() function to allow the user to enter information into a Python program.

### Do Now:
During lesson one, you created a chatbot using the following program.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/illustrations/y8l3.png" width="50%" height="auto">
</p>


Compare the above Scratch to the python code below:

```python
def ask_name():
  print("What is your name?")
  name = input()
  print("hello ", name)

print("Hello")
print("I am big Ed from the year 2182")
ask_name()
```

### Activity 1:
1. Go to the following website: <a href = "https://www.online-python.com">www.online-python.com</a>
2. Copy the above code to see it run. Does it run and can you explain what each line of code does?

### Activity 2:
Recreate your chatbot from the first lesson using the Python programming language. Your program should ask a question, save the response in a variable and include the users answer in the response. We will add the personalised responses using the "if blocks" within the next lesson.

## Lesson 4: Adding decisions to your chatbot

#### Lesson objectives
- To know what a decision is in Python.
- To be able to use a decision to check if two values are the same.
- To be able to use a decision to carry other other types of comparisons.

### Do Now:

Describe how you used the print command, input command, a function and variable in your code from last lesson.

### Activity 1

review the following code. Can you read it?

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/illustrations/y8l4.png" width="50%" height="auto">
</p>

Compare the above Scratch to the python code below. Can you see how they compare?

```python
def ask_hobby():
  print("What sports do you like?")
  sport = input()

  if sport == "football":
    print("Thats the best sport ever!")

  if sport == "basketball":
    print("I'm not tall enough for basketball")


print("Hello")
print("I am big Ed from the year 2182")
ask_hobby()
```

</p>
### Activity 2:
Add a function to your chatbot which asks the user a question and uses the if command to give a different responce depending on the users answer.

## Lesson 5: Casting and Numerical Input in Python

#### Lesson objectives

- To know how to do calculations in Python
- To be able to convert that input into a number using int() so Python can do math with it
- To be able to write simple programs that take numbers from the user and do calculations.

### Do Now:
An operator is a symbol or special word that instructs the computer to perform specific calculation or action. Guess what symbol do we use in python to do the maths calculation below:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division

| Operation     |Symbol|
|:-------------:|:----------:|
| Addition      |            |
| Subtraction.  |            | 
| Multiplication|            |
|  Division     |            | 



Imagine an expression with lots of operation. How does Python know which one to do first?

### Activity 1
Convert addition scratch code to Python
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/illustrations/addition.png"  height="auto">
</p>

```python
def addition():
    print("Enter first number")
    number1=int(input())
    print("Enter second number")
    number2=int(input())
    answer=number1+number2
    print("The answer is:", answer)
    
print("Welcome to the maths assistant 5000")
addition()
```
Create other function subtraction, multiplication, division and large number


### Activity 2
Add if statement to your code
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/illustrations/Scratch calc.png"  height="auto">
</p>


```python
def addition():
    print("Enter first number")
    number1=int(input())
    print("Enter second number")
    number2=int(input())
    answer=number1+number2
    print("The answer is:", answer)

    
print("Welcome to the maths assistant 5000")
print("What type of calculation would you like to do")
choice=input()
if choice=="addition":
    addition()
```

### Extension
- Apart from int() you can also use float() for numbers with decimal point try changing your code from int to float. 
- Python has other data types apart from integer int() and float() decimal numbers. Research what they are and give examples. 

## Lesson 5: Microbit
A micro:bit is a small, programmable computer designed to teach coding and electronics to beginners. It features an LED display, buttons, and various sensors (like an accelerometer, compass, and light sensor) for detecting motion, light, and more. Users program it using an online editor, coded with block-based or text base code, and can use its features for a wide range of projects, from creating games to collecting data.

</p>

### Extension

Create a simple reaction game using your micro:bit. The micro:bit will show a countdown, display a signal, and then measure how quickly you press Button A. 
Game instructions:
- The micro:bit will show a countdown: 3, 2, 1.
- A heart or smiley face will appear — this is your signal!
- You must press Button A as quickly as possible.
- The micro:bit will tell you if you were fast enough or too slow.

# Hint: You must use function and selection (if/else)
