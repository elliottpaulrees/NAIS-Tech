# The Project

In this unit, you’ll begin your journey into computer programming by learning key concepts using Scratch—a fun and visual way to understand how code works. Once you’ve built confidence with Scratch, you’ll move on to Python, a powerful text-based language used by real developers. The skills you learn in Python will prepare you for exciting projects later in the year, including programming robots to follow instructions and interact with the world around them. Get ready to think logically, solve problems, and bring your ideas to life through code!

## Lesson 1: Introduction input, output, variables and functions

#### Lesson objectives
- To ensure all fiels and folders are organised for the year ahead.
- To be able to use input and output commands.
- To be able to store data in variables.
- To be able to structure you code using functions.

## Lesson 2: Calculations in Scratch

#### Lesson objectives
- To be able to use decisions in your code to control the flow of logic.
- To be able to carry out comparisons such as checking if two values are equal, not equal or if one value is greater than another.
- To be able to carry out calculations which make use of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division in your code.

## Lesson 3: Introduction to Python

#### Lesson objectives
- To know a program is a set of commands that can be run by a computer for it to do a task. 
- To understand that All programming languages have rules for syntax that must be followed so that the program can run. 
- To be able to use the print() function to output information from a Python program. 
- To be able to use the input() function to allow the user to enter information into a Python program.

### Do Now:
During lesson one, you created a chatbot using the following program.

<p align="center">

</p>


Compare the above Scratch to the python code below:

```python
def ask_name():
  print("What is your name?")
  name = input()
  print("hello ", name)

print("Hello")
print("I am big Ed from the year 2182")
ask_name()
```

### Activity 1:
1. Go to the following website: <a href = "https://www.online-python.com">www.online-python.com</a>
2. Copy the above code to see it run. Does it run and can you explain what each line of code does?

### Activity 2:
Recreate your chatbot from the first lesson using the Python programming language. Your program should ask a question, save the response in a variable and include the users answer in the response. We will add the personalised responses using the "if blocks" within the next lesson.

## Lesson 4: Adding decisions to your chatbot

#### Lesson objectives
- To know what a decision is in Python.
- To be able to use a decision to check if two values are the same.
- To be able to use a decision to carry other other types of comparisons.

### Do Now:

Describe how you used the print command, input command, a function and variable in your code from last lesson.

### Activity 1

review the following code. Can you read it?

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/illustrations/y8l4.png" width="50%" height="auto">
</p>

Compare the above Scratch to the python code below. Can you see how they compare?

```python
def ask_hobby():
  print("What sports do you like?")
  sport = input()

  if sport == "football":
    print("Thats the best sport ever!")

  if sport == "basketball":
    print("I'm not tall enough for basketball")


print("Hello")
print("I am big Ed from the year 2182")
ask_hobby()
```

### Activity 2:
Add a function to your chatbot which asks the user a question and uses the if command to give a different responce depending on the users answer.


### Activity 3:

Take a look at the following code which you may have seen when building your Scratch program. You should notice the if blocks have a different type of comparison compared to the ask_hobby functions.

<img src="/images/illustrations/y8l4_2.png" width="50%" height="auto">
</p>

You can carry out a range of comparisons in your decisions:
  
| Symbol | Meaning                   | Example                |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|   ==   | Is equal to               | if name == "Mr Rees":  |
|   !=   | Not equal to              | if homework != "done": |
|   >    | greater than              | if age > 18:           |
|   <    | less then                 | if score < 50:         |
|   >=   | greater than or equal to  | if goals >= 5:         |
|   <=   | Less than or equal to     | if points <= 10:       |

Add a function to your code which contains a different type of check than what you have already used.
